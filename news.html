      <p class="news-date">March 25, 2023</p>
      <p class="news-content">According to a new study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, spending time in urban green spaces has been found to significantly improve mental health. The study found that people who spent at least 30 minutes per week in green spaces reported lower levels of stress and anxiety than those who did not.
The researchers are calling for increased investment in urban green spaces, as a way to improve public health and well-being. They suggest that creating more parks and green spaces in urban areas could have a significant impact on reducing stress and improving mental health for city residents.</p>
